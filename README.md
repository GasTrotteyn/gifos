# gifos

This is a gif finder. Using vanilla Javascript, HTML and Sass, a user interface is built to search for gifs on the Giphy platform.
It uses http calls and local storage. It also accesses the device's camera to create gifs and send them to the platform, obtaining a url to share later.

# clone repository, open it in VSC and run Go Live.
